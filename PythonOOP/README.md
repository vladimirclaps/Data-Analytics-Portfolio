# Bond Calculator

In this example of object oriented programming we have a bond calculator for a simple bond, we need to provide:
* Date of Issue.
* Date of Maturity.
* Yearly Cupon.
* Frequency of payments.
* Amortization.

With those inputs we can then call upon different methods to get:
* The bond's cashflow at any date.
* Yield (for any date and price).
* Duration (for any date and price).
* Price (for any date and yield).

Note: the program was meant as a one for all to be used along side excel where with a few transformations of the price we could also take into account indexed and different currency bonds.
